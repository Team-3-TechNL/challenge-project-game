Challenge Project Storyboard
By Ovia

Set in Ancient Rome, in the Roman Kingdom (753-509 BC). This game will have uneven terrain and platforming, which will require climbing to reach the next level. There will be obstacles in the game such as swords, spears, and daggers, and advantages such as shields. The main character of this game is an overthrown king who is the player. The overthrown king must work his way through all the levels and fight the NPC knights and king to get back to the throne. There will be NPC knights, who will help protect the new king, and make sure he stays safe. There will also be an NPC king who is the boss of the whole kingdom. The overthrown king must also get past the NPC knights and NPC king to get back to the throne. In the beginning of the game the overthrown king will start with absolutely nothing and work his way up. There will be an intro level, to learn about the basics and controls of the game. Then, there will be intermediate levels, where the king goes up various levels, which slowly get harder with difficult obstacles and an increase in knights. The final level is to defeat the NPC king and if you pass the final level, you get to keep the thrown once again. The theme of this game is rivalry, which means that there is a lot of competition between the overthrown king as well as the NPC king and knights to get/keep the throne.
